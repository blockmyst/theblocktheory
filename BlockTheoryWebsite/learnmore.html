            The Block Theory - Origin, is a generative art experiment ArtBlocks inspired, first generative work of blockmyst. You can check the code used for generation the js code of the main page (using inspect element). 
            <br><br>
            The Block Theory was originally meant for the ONE collection by Analysoor, however, even though preselected for voting did win the bounty, however, receiving quite positive feedback.
            <br><br>
            Now, the code has been revised, using seeded randomization to achieve enough variability in a small collection. The randomness is generated by seeding mint IDs of famous solana collections. 
            <br><br>
            In the main page of the site, you can test if your NFT is part of the collection or not. In any case, the page will generate the artwork related to the mint ID submitted.

            If the mint ID submitted is not part of any collection, a MultiColor Artwork will be generated. You can only generate color-based Artworks by inputting mint IDs of the respective collection (Example: inserting a MadLads mint ID will always return a Red Block generation, however, only 50 were used to be part of the collection)
            <br><br>
            You can see if your NFT was used in the collection by checking the description of each NFT.
